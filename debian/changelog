btrbk (0.18.0-1) UNRELEASED; urgency=medium

  * New upstream release.
  * MIGRATION
    - update ssh_filter_btrbk.sh on all remote hosts
    - update configuration file (/etc/btrbk/btrbk.conf):
      - "snapshot_create_always yes" -> "snapshot_create always"
      - "snapshot_create_always no"  -> "snapshot_create ondemand"
  * Set PATH variable instead of using absolute "/sbin/btrfs" for
    compatibility with all linux distros out there, which all install
    'btrfs' in different locations (close: #20).
  * Added configuration option "snapshot_create", replacing option
    "snapshot_create_always". This allows setups with multiple btrbk
    instances on several hosts (close: #18).
  * Added command line option -r (resume only).
  * Catch and display errors from "btrfs subvolume show".
  * Include systemd service and timer unit for daily backups.
